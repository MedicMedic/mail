- `EmailApiOptions:OAuthClientCrednetialsFilePath` is the location of your credentials.json file. Assuming you already downloaded the json credentials from your Gmail API.
- `EmailApiOptions:AccessTokenDirectoryPath` is the folder where the program will look for your access token. If nothing found, it will open a browser for you to give the program an access to your Gmail API, and then creates the access token.
- `EmailApiOptions:HostAddress` is your email address.
- `EmailApiOptions:HostPassword` is the 16-digit app password provided by Google. Assuming you already created an app password for your Google account.

dotnet user-secrets set AiIntegrationOptions:AcceptanceScore -0.35
```

```


### üìë Data Storage
